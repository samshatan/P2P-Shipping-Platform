## ⚙️ Backend Overview (`server/`)

**Status: Phase 2 Bridge (Infrastructure + Integrations) ✅ — Core Work Plan In Progress.**

### Core Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Node.js 20 + Express.js | ✅ Initialized |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (**Raw SQL** via `pg`) | ✅ Connected |
| **Cache** | Redis (OTP & JWT storage) | ✅ Connected |
| **Auth** | JWT (Access + Refresh Tokens) | ✅ Hardened (Rotation & Revocation) |
| **Integrations**| Razorpay & MSG91 | ✅ Initialized |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker Compose | ✅ Configured |

### Infrastructure (Docker)
Starts PostgreSQL (5432), Redis (6379), MongoDB, Kafka, MinIO, etc.
```bash
cd server
docker compose up -d
```

### Running the Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev # Server running at http://localhost:3001
```

---

## ⚠️ Key Developer Rules
1. **Raw SQL ONLY**: Do not use Prisma. Use `src/Database/db.ts` for all database interactions.
2. **Amounts**: All payment amounts to Razorpay must be in **PAISE** (`amount × 100`).
3. **Webhooks**: Always verify Razorpay signatures using `x-razorpay-signature`.
4. **Transactions**: Use `db.query('BEGIN')` / `db.query('COMMIT')` for wallet balance changes.
5. **Security**: Never log sensitive data like JWT secrets or OTPs.

---

## 📜 API Contract & Schema
The API follows the predefined contract in `server/contracts/api-contracts.md`. Database schemas are managed via manual SQL migrations located in `server/scripts/`.
